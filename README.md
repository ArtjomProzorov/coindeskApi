# Project Title

Fetching and manipulating with CoinDesk data

## Description

Command-line Java program that fetches data from the CoinDesk public API

www.coindesk.com/api

Once executed, the program should request the user to input a currency code (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)

Once the user provides the currency code, the application should display the following information:

The current Bitcoin rate, in the requested currency

The lowest Bitcoin rate in the last 30 days, in the requested currency

The highest Bitcoin rate in the last 30 days, in the requested currency

If the currency code provided is not supported by the API, a message should inform the user.
